## Datasets used
1. Penguin Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/parulpandey/penguin-dataset-the-new-iris
2. Diamond Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds

## Part I: Data Analysis and Preprocessing
This part focuses on data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis for two datasets: 'penguins' and 'diamond' datasets. The following operations were performed: importing necessary libraries, reading and preprocessing the datasets, handling missing entries through imputation or row removal, standardizing string formats, detecting and managing outliers through removal or imputation, generating data visualization graphs using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn, identifying and removing uncorrelated features, converting string features to categorical representations using one-hot or label encoding, and normalizing non-categorical features to a common scale. These steps ensure data quality, consistency, and prepare the datasets for further machine learning model development and training.

## Part II: Logistic Regression
This section focuses on implementing logistic regression from scratch for the 'penguins' dataset. This implementation avoids using scikit-learn or other libraries with built-in logistic regression functions.

## Part III: Linear Regression and Ridge Regression
This section focuses on implementing linear regression and ridge regression from scratch. This implementation avoids using scikit-learn or other libraries with built-in logistic regression functions.
